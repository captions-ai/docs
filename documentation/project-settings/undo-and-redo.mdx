title: "Undo & Redo"
---

Undo and redo allows you to edit without worrying about making a mistake.

<Note>
    Undo and Redo is only possible while you are actively editing. Once you close the app or save your project (and return to the project screen), you wonâ€™t be able to Undo any longer.

        To **undo** an action, simply tap the icon above the timeline. A notification will appear letting you know which action you've just undone. Need to redo an action? Simply tap the **redo** button.
        You can **undo** or **redo** as often as you like within a single session, but once you return to the Project screen (either by saving or exporting), you won't be able to undo or redo.
