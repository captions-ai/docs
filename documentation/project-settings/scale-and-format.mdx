        **Change your content fit**

        - Fill - Your video will be scaled to fill the entire frame. If your video's aspect ratio is not the same as the frame, you'll notice that the video will be cropped.
        - Fit - Your video will be scaled to fit entirely within the frame. If your video's aspect ratio is not the same as the frame, you'll see black pillars on the sides.
        - Auto - Your video will fill the entire frame and we'll use AI to attempt to center the frame on the important content of the video.
