# Teams
We are in the process of building more team options so that a single owner can manage billing for multiple people on your team. For now, if you are a Max customer, you’ll see the option (in the profile section) to invite up to 2 teammates free of charge. By adding a member to your team, you are simply providing them with a subscription. Cloud syncing and more collaboration tools are coming soon.
